<h2> Unique Characteristics and Behavior of Barn Owls</h2>
<h3>Habitat and Distribution of Barn Owls</h3>

<p>
Barn owls are found in a wide range of habitats, from open countryside and farmlands to urban areas, provided there are
sufficient nesting sites and prey. They are distributed across most parts of the world, with the exception of the polar
regions and dense rainforests. These owls prefer areas with tall grasses, open fields, and woodlands, where they can
hunt for small mammals such as mice, voles, and rats. They are highly adaptable and have even been known to nest in
barns, churches, and abandoned buildings, which is how they earned their name. Their ability to thrive in diverse
environments makes them one of the most widespread owl species globally.

<p>
Barn owls are particularly known for their <strong>exceptional</strong> hunting skills, relying on their acute hearing and silent flight
to catch prey. Their heart-shaped facial disc helps funnel sound to their ears, allowing them to detect even the
faintest movements of small animals in complete darkness. With their ability to fly nearly silently, barn owls can hunt
at night without alerting their prey, making them highly effective nocturnal predators. This unique combination of
sensory adaptations makes them incredibly efficient hunters in a variety of environments.
